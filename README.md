Script to migrate from Self Service Classic to Self Service+

Jamf has not yet recommended migrating exclusively to Self Service+. For official guidance, refer to their documentation: https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/self-service-plus-documentation/page/About_Self_Service_Plus.html)

This is still in development. I have a new version of the script that I'm refining. It uses swiftDialog and the overall quality of the script is better.
I'll post in the next couple of weeks.
